# battleship
Battleship!

In this project I am going to create the game of battleship! I am going to accomplish this using tdd as this is a new concept for me. My goals for this project is that I write down the different tests that I want to pass for each of my different functions/game-logic and then write the code to get them to pass. Ideally every function should NOT be tightly coupled!!
